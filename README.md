flyingparticles (mouse version)
=======================

Result of the Interface Lab project week @ FH Potsdam led by Fabian Mor√≥n Zirfas (fabiantheblind).

#Summary

<p>The example (https://www.processing.org/examples/regularpolygon.html) at Processing.org, showed me how to create and turn polygons in an easy way.

<p>I tried to move my polygons with mouse movements but I wasn't satisfied with the result (http://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/155245) so I kept on working. 

<p>In a second vesion I concentrated on making the movement of the polygons look more smooth (http://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/155246).

<p>In the class with Fabian, he showed this example: http://www.learningprocessing.com/examples/chapter-16/example-16-13/ by Daniel Shiffman which turns simple motion capturing into movement by processing.
I used my mac book camera to capture movements while creating graphical elements within the center of my canvas.

Unfortunately the result doesn't work within the browser so I created a version, which uses the mouse instead, too.
